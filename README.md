# git-crypt for Windows

### About
It`s auto build [AGWA/git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) for Windows.

### Installation
The easiest way to get started with the git-crypt is to download the [latest release](https://github.com/oholovko/git-crypt-windows/releases) and copy it in to yours Git folder.

For example, for me full way to git-crypt file looks like this:

```cmd
C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git-crypt.exe
```

After that, for start work you can open yours git-bash or cmd console and try to write:  
```cmd
git-crypt
```

If you accidentally got here, but want to use git-crypt on Linux, please, go to [LINUX_README.md](https://github.com/oholovko/git-crypt-windows/blob/master/LINUX_README.md).

**Thats all.**
